            <h4>La La Land is the story of an aspiring actress named Mia and a dedicated jazz musician named Sebastian 
                who have a few chance meetings in the city of Los Angeles. While the pair pursues their own dreams in a town 
                known for dashing them, the two begin a romance. However as each one finds success in their own way, 
                they are faced with decisions that pits their love for one another against their dreams of success. 
                It threatens to tear the two apart. In the end, Mia and Sebastian must decide what is more important to them; 
                a once-in-a-lifetime chance at love or a once-in-a-lifetime moment in the spotlight.</h4>
