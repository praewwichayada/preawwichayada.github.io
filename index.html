        <h4>Movies are not only entertaining, but they also allow us to feel different 
            emotions such as happiness, sadness, loved and many more, These are the reason
            why I  watching movies. Movies allow us to escape reality for while and 
            immerse ourselves into a different world whether it be a world 
            full of talking toys, superheroes or even a zombie apocalypse!!
            It allows you to fantasize and imagine what you could do in that world.
            Besides, you can also learn from movies, not just educational information 
            but also different life lessons. After the end of the movie you can find yourself
            finishing it with at least a little bit more knowledge than you were before.
            For these reasons, movies are definitely an enjoyable, entertaining and fun 
            experience, which we will continue to enjoy for many more years.
